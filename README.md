Mouse_Wiggler is a small Digispark (http://digistump.com/products/1) sketch to emulate mouse movement, most likely to keep a screen saver from kicking in.  The Digispark will behave as a mouse and move the mouse up, down, left and right at pseudo-random times.  It will also peridically blink the onboard LED so you know its wiggling.
